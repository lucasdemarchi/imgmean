DEPENDENCIES:

	- You need a version of freeimage (http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/). Any
	  version should work right.

COMPILING

Makefile and Makefile.flags have some options to tune the compilation. All the
tunable parameters are in form of "parameter := setting", so it's easy to
tune without depending in third party tools. The default is to optimize for
core2 processors.

To compile:

$ make

In the same folder will be the compiled program, imgmean

PORTING

It's not difficult to port to other platforms as only are few things are
Linux specific (like setting the affinity of a thread).
